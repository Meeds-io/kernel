 * Thrown when a definition error occurs.

 * 
 * <p>
 * Definition errors are developer errors. They may be detected by tooling at development time, and are also detected by the
 * container at initialization time. If a definition error exists in a deployment, initialization will be aborted by the
 * container.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The container is permitted to define a non-portable mode, for use at development time, in which some definition errors do not
 * cause application initialization to abort.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * An implementation is permitted to throw a subclass of {@link DefinitionException} for any definition error which exists.
